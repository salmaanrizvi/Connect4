Connect 4: Powered Up!
Copyright © Salmaan Rizvi
Version 1.0

This code produced a game of Connect 4, in the classic sense, with both a GUI and text-based output. Modifications to the game include Power Ups. These power ups are invisible to the users playing the game and are randomly placed on the game board. Included power ups are:

* Blast: Blasts all adjacent pieces away (up to 8 pieces). Blast can be found anywhere on the board.

* Column Crusher: "Crushes" an entire column by removing all pieces in the column power was found. Both pieces and other power ups are removed. Column crushers are found anywhere in the top 3 rows.

* Color Reversal: All pieces currently on the game board are reversed in color such that red pieces become black pieces and vice versa. The players are still their respective colors.

* Rain Pieces: Three black and three red pieces are randomly dropped onto the game board.

All entries to the game board are done via text input from an input prompt. To play, run the package files through a program such as Eclipse or Dr. Java.
